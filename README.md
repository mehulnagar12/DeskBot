THE PROJECT IS MADE USING THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT API, DIALOGFLOW AND NODEMAILER.
FOR STORAGE OF INFORMATION GOOGLE FIRESTORE IS USED.

THE PROJECT IS A ROBOT (CHATTING ROBOT) FOR A RECEPTION DESK THAT WILL ANSWER THE FAQ'S RELATED TO THE COMPANY.
ALSO IF SOME VISITOR WANTS TO MEET AN EMPLOYEE AND IF HE ASKS THE ROBOT, THEN AN AUTOMATIC MAIL WOULD BE SENT TO THE EMPLOYEE,
TO NOTIFY HIM/HER.

WE CAN ALSO PLAY A SIMPLE GAME USING THE BOT, IF THE INTENT PLAY GAME IS TRIGGERED THEN THE ROBOT WILL ASK THE NAME OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL PLAYING, IF HE IS REGISTERED THEN THE QUESTION WILL BE ASKED AS PRESENT IN THE DATABASE AND THE ANSWER WHICH THE USER
GIVES IS CONVERTED INTO TEXT AND STORED IN THE DATABASE.
